2100_mips_picked_021716.txt file is basically just mipgen output. 
reference_locus_master_2100_20160220.csv is put together using both mipgen output and certain STR charateristics that are used in building a synthetic reference. i can't find how Ashley put it together exactly but it seems pretty straightforward assuming you have the relevant information.

other things are output from making synthetic references.
